My very first application, created while learning via Bloc.io.  Demonstrates a bunch of stuff, like authentication, authorization, MVC concept, scopes, private methods, and so on.

Please feel free to use a different markup language if you do not plan to run
<tt>rake doc:app</tt>.
## Bloccit: a Reddit clone to teach the fundamentals of web development and Rails 4.

Made with my mentor at [Bloc](http://bloc.io).
